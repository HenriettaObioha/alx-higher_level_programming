DESCRIPTION

This repository contains the practical coding exercises and examples for the Python programming language that illustrate how to use Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) or Object-DataBase Mapping (ODM) to interact with databases.

The concepts of ORM or ODM can be explained in simple terms as a programming technique that defines a mapping between our database tables and the classes or objects that we use in our application. In other words, ORM helps us to avoid writing raw SQL queries and provides a more convenient high-level interface to work with the database without the need to know the underlying database technology.

ORM is a useful tool that enables developers to focus on the main functionality of their application without worrying about the details of the database management, allowing them to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data from the database using Python code.
